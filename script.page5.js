    "Because I think games offer more interaction. Unlike manga/comics or novels where you just read, in games, you can actively control certain things.",
    "I think a major reason is that most games I play have some form of storyline, and the character I like exists within the game's world, experiencing various events and having their own stories.",
    "Yes, it's Li Zeyan from the dating simulator mobile game Love: Queen's Choice.",
    "I think it's because the games I play are very immersive. Many game companies do things to help break the fourth wall, like having characters say things that make it seem like they're really talking to you through the game.",
    "Yes.",
    "There have indeed been changes.",
    "Yes, and my mindset has subtly shifted.",
    "Right, manga/comics and books feel like time is frozen at a moment, but games feel like time is stretched out over a long period.",

    "So, based on this medium, how do you establish parasocial relationships with fictional characters?",

    "I see, so while it's ostensibly a dating simulator game, it provided you with more than just gameplayâ€”it overlapped with real-life events, giving you a sense of constant companionship. This might be a characteristic of virtual characters; their virtual nature means they're always there, unaffected by time.",

    "Do you think this relationship has had any impact on your real-life? Are these impacts positive, negative, or a mix of both?",

This prompts you to establish relationships with the characters, and they are also a place for you to escape from reality, but at the same time, through their character stories or behaviors, you find the strength to face reality.",
