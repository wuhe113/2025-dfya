                        <b>H</b> Before you were selected as the interviewee, I learned that you have experience building parasocial relationships with fictional characters. Could you briefly describe through which mediums (manga/comics, anime/animation, games, novels, movies, TV dramas, etc.) you primarily establish such relationships with fictional characters?
                        </div>
                    <div class="interviewee">
                        <b>T</b> It was through fan creations, like fanart. Fan works attracted me first, and then I became interested in the fictional characters, which led me to explore the original works and get to know them better.

                        <b>T</b> All kinds, but mostly illustrations and written works. Those two types are what drew me in the most.

                    <div>
                        <b>H</b> Based on these mediums, how did you build parasocial relationships with the fictional characters?
                        </div>
                    <div class="interviewee">
                        <b>T</b> Well, the character I want to talk about is <span class="character">Wang Yao</span><span class="introduction"> Wang Yao(China) is the personification of China. He is the oldest nation in the Allies, being depicted as immortal as well as being over four or five thousand years old, and is regarded as the eldest sibling among the East Asian nations.</span> from Hetalia: Axis Powers. Honestly, I feel like my interest in this character comes more from fan creations than from the original work. It might sound funny, but I don’t think I got his charm from the original  work.

                    <div class="interviewee">
                        I feel like I got to know his charm through the works created by people who also love him within the fandom. It’s mainly the way he’s portrayed in fanart and his personality in those works that attracted me.
                        </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>H</b> Why do you think the original portrayal of this character wasn’t as appealing to you?
                        </div>
                    <div class="interviewee">
                        <b>T</b> First of all, the subject matter of the work is quite sensitive since it involves historical and political elements. Over time, the characters in the original work feel like they’ve become OOC (out of character) due to the author’s handling. Also, while the original is a manga, it has spawned anime and stage performance, and the character’s personality varies across these different mediums. That’s why I find this character a bit more complex compared to others.
                        <br>
                        <br>So, I think the charm of this work lies in how fanart fills in the gaps left by the original. The original work leaves a lot of blanks in portraying this character, and fanart helps complete his character image.
                        </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>H</b> Could you describe what kind of parasocial relationship you have with this character?
                        </div>
                    <div class="interviewee">
                        <b>T</b> It’s hard to describe, but I think I see him as a younger brother, and I’m like his older sister. I want to tease him or dress him up. My feelings for this character aren’t straightforward or typical. I’m drawn to the gender-neutral characteristic of his character, which feel rare in male characters. It’s like he has traits that are usually associated with femininity, and that contrast is something I really like. That’s what I like about fictional characters—they often have traits that are uncommon or not absolute in real life.
                        </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>H</b> Why do you think you developed this kind of relationship? How did the character resonate with you emotionally or in other ways?
                        </div>
                    <div class="interviewee">
                        <b>T</b> I think it goes back to fanart. I’m not someone who enjoys reading novels, but most of the text I read is fanfiction. Before I even knew this character, I read some famous fanfics within the fandom and wondered, “What kind of person is he that inspires so many amazing works?” That made me want to learn more about him. The original work itself is very supportive of fan creations, so I feel like the character I came to love was shaped more by fan works than by the original work.
                        <br>
                        <br>In my mind, there are three versions of Wang Yao’s personality, but they’re all the same person: one from the stage performance, one from fan works, and one from the original manga. They’re all him, but I prefer the fan-created version.
                        <br>
                        <br>Another aspect of his charm is that he’s a nation—he’s not a human in the conventional sense. He’s a personification of a country, so he doesn’t have the same emotions as humans. I like that about him—his non-human qualities are part of his appeal.
                        </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>H</b> Do you think this relationship has had any impact on your real-life? Are these impacts positive, negative, or a mix of both?
                        </div>
                    <div class="interviewee">
                        <b>T</b> I don’t think it’s affected my life negatively, but it has added some fun to it. For example, when I visit museums now, I might notice things I wouldn’t have paid attention to before knowing this character. The work has historical references, and I wasn’t particularly good at history in school or interested in it before. But because of this character, I find myself paying more attention to certain things, like realizing, “Oh, this is something I read about before,” or “This is how it works.” It’s made me more curious about things I might not have cared about otherwise. So, I’d say it’s had a positive influence—it’s broadened my horizons.
                        </div>
                    <div>
                        <b>H</b> Lastly, have you made any efforts for this relationship? (e.g., creating fanart, cosplay, buying merchandise, participating in related events, etc.)
                        </div>
                    <div class="interviewee">
                        <b>T</b> I’ve tried drawing him, but sometimes I don’t feel like it. For me, the reason I hesitate to draw characters I like is that I feel like I can’t capture their essence. I’ve attempted to draw him many times, but I’m never fully satisfied. Still, I do draw him occasionally because his appearance is relatively easy to capture. But it’s like, you can draw the outside, but not the inside.
                        <br>
                        <br>Part of why I don’t like the original portrayal is that Wang Yao should be the most complex character among all the nations because he’s the oldest. But the original author makes him seem too childish, like there’s no depth to him. So, when I draw him, I don’t just make him look tired—I try to capture his charm, which lies in his baby face but deeply layered personality. He has a lot of history behind him, 5,000 years of it, and that’s what I want to convey.

                 In this section, the topics surrounding fan followings are discussed. There positive aspects of fandoms, such as the opportunity for the creation of real relationships and the sharing of the love of the characters through different venues. There are also negative parts in being a member of a fandom, such as the arguments that occur over different components the media which can turn into cyberbullying, and/or threats to individuals in these groups.

                <div>
                Although this relationship with video game characters is slightly different, there are fan followings to all different types of characters and medias. Fan followings can be also referred to as fandoms. A “fandom” is a group of fans of a piece of media that interact with the media in various ways. This includes, discussing the media on social networking sites, drawing fanart and/or writing fanfiction and sharing these works, and creating theories about the characters and the plotlines of the original work.
                </div>
                <div>
                Duchesne stated, “fandom is a particular kind of performance that many members boldly explore, playing with identity and finding their own layers of meaning” (as cited in Rahman et al., 2012, p.320).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref1">1</sup> Members of fandoms find their own meaning to the original work. They play with the identity of the characters, as well as forming their own identities through these characters.
                </div>
                <div>
                Being in a fandom can have emotional benefits and can aid in the individual member’s identity formation (Tukachinsky, 2015).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref2">2</sup> People in fandoms can communicate and build a friendship with other people in the fandom while discussing their favorite medias (Hiromi & Saori, 2015).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref3">3</sup> With this connection, the parasocial relationships can become more intensified because they are now associated with both the media and the friendships that are created from the shared love of the media (Hiromi & Saori, 2015).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref4">4</sup> The more that a member identifies with a group, their view of self is linked to the group as a whole (Tukachinsky, 2015).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref5">5</sup>

                    Since there may be a need to maintain and increase their sense of self in a fandom, members are driven to promote their fandom positively (Tukachinsky, 2015).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref6">6</sup> This can be toxic in the way that other fandoms are bashed as a result. Also, the promotion of the original work, the preferred ships (pairings of characters that fans want to be in a romantic relationship with each other) and “fanon” (aspects of the work that is based on fan theory to the extent that it is seen as practically canon by some members), can cause tension between members of the same fandom (C. Linden, personal communication, January 25, 2018).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref7">7</sup> This tension could lead to cyber bullying, threats, and/or fights between members of the same fandom (C. Linden, personal communication, January 25, 2018).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref8">8</sup>
                </div>
                <div>
                    Through cognitive dissonance, members of a fandom can change their attitudes, thoughts and behaviors to restore the regulation between their own opinions on the content and the behaviors they display while on social media websites (Tukachinsky, 2015).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref9">9</sup> This is why some fandoms are seen as “toxic.” An example of this is the fandom of the show Steven Universe. The show itself promotes love and acceptance of people from different walks of life, while the fandom is the polar opposite. There are “shipping wars,” which are arguments about which characters should be paired together (C. Linden, personal communication January 25, 2018).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref10">10</sup> Also, much of the fanart is viciously criticized for not having the characters portrayed in a certain view (C. Linden, personal communication January 25, 2018; Guth, 2015).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref11">11 12</sup>
                </div>
                <div>
                    Fandoms help promote the continuation of parasocial relationships with characters. The fandom of a particular media can assist with the connection to a character through discussions, arguments, theorizing, and art making of the character. Fanfiction, fanart, and cosplay pictures are shared in these fandoms through social media sites, which helps deepen the parasocial relationships for many audience members.

                    Many people have attachments to fictional characters that can be likened to friendships, a form of an alternate self through vicarious watching or even through a romantic crush. The creation of fanart and fanfiction is an extension of this attachment with people creating a new form of their favorite medias. People can also become their character for a brief period of time through cosplay.

                    In the first section, fanfiction and fanart are discussed as two different types of ways to use characters in an artform. Fanart is a visual artform with a character represented in the piece created by an enthusiast of the original media that the character resides. Fanfiction is a form of writing that uses existing characters in a new storyline penned by a fan. These characters can be shifted into anything that the artmaker wants during the creation of a piece of fanart or fanfiction as exemplified by a study by Hiromi and Saori (2015) discussed about the fandom of “fujoshi” in Japan and the artwork that they create using existing characters. In the second section, the artform of cosplay is explained and discussed. Cosplay is the performing art of dressing as a character and these costumes are usually handmade by their wearers. A study by Rahman, Liu, and Cheung (2012) is examined about a cosplay subgroup in Hong Kong.

                    Fanfiction is the creation of a story with existing characters, story universe, and/or alteration of an existing plot. Fanart is an art piece created with characters from a form of media. Both artforms express the creators’ relationship with the existing media and characters. Many of these pieces can take hours, weeks, or even years to complete. Upon completion, these artworks are often shared via social media sites (i.e. Tumblr, Facebook, Instagram) or websites that are designed for sharing such works (e.g. Deviantart, Patreon, or fanfiction.net). Some creators also have tables at various conventions to display and sell their works to other fans. Even though creating fanfiction or fanart is often stigmatized in society by those that don’t participate, it is a labor of love for many.

                    One of the types of media that is stigmatized in Japan is yaoi or boy love (BL), which centers around love stories between two men. Hiromi and Saori (2015) conducted a survey that focused on a fandom known as “Fujoshi,” which translates to “Rotten girls.” These fans are primarily heterosexual women that read romance graphic novels involving homosexual couples (Hiromi & Saori, 2015). Some of the fans, in addition to reading the manga produced by professional artists, create works of both characters in other “yaoi” works and characters in other popular series that are typically “boys’” media (i.e. manga in action, adventure or sports genres) (Hiromi & Saori, 2015). Fujoshi also share a bond of being in the fandom which separates them from non-Fujoshi in both positive and negative ways (Hiromi & Saori, 2015). One of the theories discussed as to why this genre is popular with the Fujoshi is that these women enjoy reading these stories because there are no female characters being forced to act submissive, which is an escape from the oppression of women (and their sexuality) in Japanese society (Hiromi & Saori, 2015).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref13">13</sup>

                <div>
                    Fanfiction and fanart are a type of love letter to the character that a person has a parasocial relationship with. These works are also shared among other fans in social media sites. Sometimes the comments that are made on this work can be positive and can raise the self- esteem of the creator of the work (C. Linden, personal communication January 25, 2018).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref14">14</sup> These comments can also be very negative and damaging to the artist or writer’s sense of self and creative ability (C. Linden, personal communication January 25, 2018; Guth, 2015).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref15">15 16</sup> The creation of any art piece with a character as the muse helps strengthen the parasocial relationship that the artist, writer or cosplayer has with their favorite characters.

                    Cosplay is putting on a costume of a character. For many this is an important ritual that occurs before attending a convention or a Halloween gathering. Some make these costumes from scratch, which can often take months to complete, while others buy these costumes online. There are varying levels of skill in cosplayers, from beginner to expert or (referred in many online communities as) “God-level.” One of the things that is common for all of these fans is that they are able to embody a character that they have a parasocial relationship with, even if it is for a few hours.

                    Rahman et al. (2012) conducted a study of the subculture of cosplay in Hong Kong using interviews and observations of cosplayers at a convention. The researchers participated in cosplay while interviewing members of this subculture, as well as photographed the experience. There were fifteen participants in this study and were interviewed both during causal conversations (twelve participants), and structured in-depth interviews (two participants) (Rahman et al., 2012). All of the participants were cosplayers of various skill levels and had varying opinions of the subject. One of the novice cosplayers was nervous putting on the costume and becoming the character (Rahman et al., 2012). Another participant, who saw herself as a “professional cosplayer,” felt that certain people wearing costumes are not actually cosplayers and that others should put more effort into their cosplay costumes and personas (Rahman et al., 2012). Rahman et al. stated, “Cosplay enables enthusiasts to imitate the personas of their adored characters and to re-create an imaginative self in reality” (2012, p.321).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref17">17</sup>
                </div>
                <div>
                    Cosplayers usually put their photos of their costume on display via social media sites, on Halloween and at conventions, such as the San Diego Comic Con. During this period, a person can embody their favorite characters for a short amount of time, get pictures taken of them and meet other fans of the original medias. Becoming a different person could be a therapeutic experience for some fans because it can give them strength, confidence and an escape from reality while wearing the costume.

                    Parasocial relationships are an integral part of some people’s lives. Through the development of the relationship, the strengthening of it during the creation of fanfiction, fanart and cosplay, and the emotions that are evoked through viewing the character’s story audience members connect to these fictional characters. Derrick et al. (2008) stated, “...although people consciously know that parasocial relationships are not real relationships, in many ways they feel psychologically real and meaningful” (p.262).<sup class="footnote" data-id="ref18">18</sup>
