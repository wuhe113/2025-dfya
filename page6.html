                 In this section, the topics surrounding fan followings are discussed. There positive aspects of fandoms, such as the opportunity for the creation of real relationships and the sharing of the love of the characters through different venues.

                Although this relationship with video game characters is slightly different, there are fan followings to all different types of characters and medias. Fan followings can be also referred to as fandoms. A “fandom” is a group of fans of a piece of media that interact with the media in various ways. This includes, discussing the media on social networking sites, drawing fanart and/or writing fanfiction and sharing these works, and creating theories about the characters and the plotlines of the original work.

                Duchesne stated, “fandom is a particular kind of performance that many members boldly explore, playing with identity and finding their own layers of meaning” (as cited in Rahman et al., 2012, p.320). Members of fandoms find their own meaning to the original work. They play with the identity of the characters, as well as forming their own identities through these characters.

                Being in a fandom can have emotional benefits and can aid in the individual member’s identity formation (Tukachinsky, 2015). People in fandoms can communicate and build a friendship with other people in the fandom while discussing their favorite medias (Hiromi & Saori, 2015). With this connection, the parasocial relationships can become more intensified
