                These characters might also be having similar emotions to the audience member during these experiences. Kokesh and Sternadori (2015) have found through their research of young adult novels and interviews with the readers of this genre of books, that if the media is seen as realistic, then the people consuming it are more likely to develop a parasocial relationship with the characters. When people that are taking in the media felt that they shared experiences with a character, it is more likely that they will find the story more realistic.<sub class="footnote" data-id="ref1">26</sub>
                <br>
                <br>Even if the media is not seen as realistic and lives in the fantasy realm, it can help audiences through difficult and scary situations. Characters could serve as a vessel for a person’s fears and serve as a way of attaining mastery of their fears.<sub class="footnote" data-id="ref2">27</sub> For example, the children from the movie It (specifically the 2017 version) have fears that are reflected to them through the character of Pennywise (a shapeshifting creature that wants to eat the children’s bodies and fears).<sub class="footnote" data-id="ref3">28</sub> Through seeing their fears being worked through in literally beating Pennywise while he is shapeshifting, the audience could find their fears as something that they could “beat” or work through.

                In addition to helping with conquering fears, a parasocial relationship can be a part of identity formation. Parasocial relationships can have impacts to the viewers’ lives especially when they are part of their development. People can be more likely to attach themselves to objects that have a significant meaning to their identity.<sub class="footnote" data-id="ref4">29</sub> Therefore, if a type of media was important in a time in someone’s life then it is more likely that they will attach themselves to the characters. Many people think fondly of characters that have part of their development in childhood. Shows like Arthur, Blue’s Clues, and Sailor Moon still have a large following because of the nostalgia aspect.<sub class="footnote" data-id="ref5">30</sub>
                <br>
                <br>People usually respond to their favorite characters in a similar way that they respond to someone that is close in their lives because the strong parasocial attachment.<sub class="footnote" data-id="ref6">31</sub> For example, many people call their favorite characters pet names while they post pictures of them online. Many other people talk about their characters and their events as if they were talking about a friend that they saw recently. Others may gossip and make theories about what is going to happen to their favorite characters. People cry when characters go through hardships or die in their stories. There is a real emotional investment in these characters lives, even though they are fictional.
